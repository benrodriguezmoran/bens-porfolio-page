            Hello! My name is Benjamin Rodriguez-Moran - just Ben Rodriguez if that's too much - and this is my portfolio page. 
            Here you'll get to learn a little about me, my hobbies, life, and my work.
            I've had a passion for understanding the mechanics of any kind of thing for as long as I can remember - I was very
            fond of Lego growing up. By the time I was gifted my first 3D printer, I already dove deep into CAD and design principles
            and was ready to apply it. Now I've brushed up on a number of diciplines when designing; one of my projects in 
            particular necesitated me to learn C and solder up an avionics computer with a micro controller. 
            Simply, I just like to push my knowledge and find what I learn on the way. I am also a prominent space enthusiast,
            the video game Kerbal Space Program is a large influence to that, as well as my passion for game design. The pictures beside
            in order are: me and my lovely girlfriend Anna, my dog Cherry with my cat Mochi outside, my other cat Luna with Cherry, and 
            a screenshot of a spacecraft I made in Kerbal Space Program.

                <p>Two 8 inch 3 blade propellers and a servo controlled gimbal, the goal is to build a 
                    system to debug and tune inertial measurement systems for anticipated model rocket launches, 
                    and fly itself. The platform will let me use a radio control to fly this as you would a traditional
                    quadracopter, with some caviats, or fly a preprogrammed trajectory mimicking one of a model rocket
                    launch.

                <h2><a>Teensy 3.2 Avionics Unit</a></h2>
                <p>This is the brain of the previously featured drone, it utilizes a Teensy 3.2 MCU paired with an accelerometer and barometer
                    to interpolate the current trajectory and cross check with our altitude pressure reading. The control flow first obtains
                    a gravity aligned inertial reference, and intergrates to determine its position. It will take both radio inputs and fly 
                    preplanned trajectories.

                <p>Godot is a free and open source game engine which has been an absolute thrill to learn. The game's scope is large - our solar system large
